      "[<p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Consider the Tesla Model 3. Mine is fun, which brings joy and contentment.  I look forward to each drive. <br/><br/>Over the air updates and a good autopilot system keeps the car renewable and removes some of the mind numbing heavy traffic.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">This is for our amazing experience with the service center.  They went above and beyond for us and it was the best repair experience we've ever had with any car.<br/><br/>We had a warranty repair on our Model Y that was going to take a long time to complete.  The shop was incredibly understanding and helpful about our kids and car seats and worked with us to plan ahead.  <br/><br/>When the day came they fixed a major issue for us 40% faster than expected, and they fixed a minor issue even though we didn't think the parts were in stock!  Finally, they were ultra flexible with us on pickup.  THANK YOU!</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Today I went to the San Francisco Tesla Dealer for the first time and I was impressed! Great customer service! I would like to thank Nick who helped me out today, he was so knowledgeable and was amazing at answering all my questions and explaining all about the features I didn't know about the new Model Y I ordered. He went as far as setting an appointment for me at another Tesla location that had the exact car I wanted and I got to drive it today! I was overall very satisfied with my visit and he gave me reassure that I was making the right decision of choosing a model for my needs. I am excited for my new Tesla!</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Crappy plastic piece falls off the bottom of the model y, exposing all kinds of important hardware, so often they make an aftermarket replacement for it but tesla doesn't cover it under their warranty! <br/>They charged me $250 for something that should be covered by warranty. I'll be waiting for the recall to get my money back.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Well, I had an issue with my Tesla. Took it into the service center on Thursday. They called me earlier today to tell me to come in and pick up my car and then summarily canceled the Uber voucher that I was given. <br/><br/>I'M CURRENTLY ON THE CALTRAIN TO SAVE THEM $ AND NOT USE IT ALL. THEN I WENT TO ORDER A RIDE AND IT SAID CANCELED <br/><br/>WOW. Last Tesla I own.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Do you love having your car held hostage for things that aren't your fault? If so, this location is 100% for you. My guy Kenny is king grinch. If you want a poor customer service experience where you get made to feel like you at fault for the dealer's shoddy service, this guy is your knight in shining armor.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Kevin and Bridget were amazing. I purchased a used Tesla abs picked it up in Rocklin. That experience was horrible and made me second guess my purchase. Kevin gave me a real live tutorial, showed me how everything works and answered all the questions about all the features in my model 3 long range. They redeemed my confidence in this company and am truly grateful for the time they took with me. Bridget was very apologetic and told me she would follow up on the poor experience I received in Rocklin. Please reward and acknowledge Kevin and Bridget for being the best way to build trust and confidence in the Tesla company and product. I will definitely go back to them if I have any other questions.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">I am appalled by the poor service at this Tesla location.  First, you cannot speak to anyone in Service directly - when you call, you are sent to an automated message that directs you to an app (and you can then only correspond via messaging in the app, with often multiple days delay).  <br/><br/>Today, I called in to the sales department - the only way to get a live person on the phone - and I explained that the door to my brand new model X would not open. He refused to help me with my request, simply saying, \"I need to wait to hear back.\"  And then when I asked to speak to a manager, he hung up on me!  Completely unacceptable level of service, especially given the price tag of these automobiles.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Dear dad can you buy me a Tesla to drive at grad school!</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__gu0rG css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">I ended up filing a complaint against them with the California Bureau of Automotive Repair for not refunding me for replacement parts that weren't actually required to repair my car and didn't fix my issues.<br/><br/>Sigh. Tesla keeps letting me down with post-warranty support.<br/><br/>Time for a new car anyway-- It's not gonna be a Tesla.</span></p>]\n"
